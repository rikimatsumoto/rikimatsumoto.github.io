## Lead

**UN Security Council approves U.S.-backed resolution endorsing Trump’s 20‑point Gaza plan.**  
The UNSC passed a resolution backing the Trump administration’s Gaza framework including an international stabilisation mission and a “Board of Peace.” Israel objects to elements of governance authority; Hamas excluded. *Assessment:* Diplomatic inflection point shaping the next phase of regional security dynamics. **(Moderate–High confidence)**

---

## Regional Spotlights

### Levant / Israel–Lebanon

- No major cross‑border kinetic developments overnight. Gaza-centred diplomatic shifts expected to influence Israeli posture in the north. **(Moderate confidence)**  
- **Indicators:** UNIFIL mobility/spot reports; IDF/LAF friction points; Hezbollah messaging on UNSC resolution.

---

### Black Sea / Ukraine

- **Russian missile strike** killed three and wounded ten in Balakliia (Kharkiv).  
- **Odesa region** hit by drones/missiles, sparking fires at port sites; 36,500 households temporarily without power.  
- *Assessment:* Russia continues systematic targeting of energy/port infrastructure ahead of winter. **(High confidence)**  
- **Watch:** Ukrainian repair tempo, AD depletion, and port export interruptions.

---

### South China Sea / Philippines

- No new major incidents as of 17 Nov ET. **(Low–Moderate confidence)**  
- **Business angle:** Sustained insurance risk for Luzon-adjacent sea lanes; Manila’s ROE shifts remain a near-term variable.

---

### Latin America / Venezuela

- No major new escalatory events reported overnight. **(Low confidence)**  
- Previous days highlighted U.S. military planning conversations and Colombia’s intelligence cooperation suspension; still shaping diplomatic and shipping risk environment.

---

### Africa / Sahel–Horn–Sudan

- No fresh large-scale developments. **(Low confidence)**  
- Structural risks remain: corridor insecurity, aid disruption, and RSF/SAF maneuvering near Darfur and Gezira.

## Watch Items (24–72h)

1. **Gaza resolution implementation:** troop contributions, financing, Israeli/Russian signalling.  
2. **Ukraine winter targeting:** uptick in drone/missile strikes on grid and port nodes.  
3. **SCS resupply cycles:** water-cannoning/shouldering risks around Ayungin/Scarborough.  
4. **Venezuela regional posture:** U.S.–Saudi arms developments; Colombian political moves.  
5. **European transit security:** follow-up on Polish rail sabotage implications.

## Annex — Business & Financial Indicators

### Energy
- **Oil dips** after loadings resume at Novorossiysk export hub. *Implication:* Short-term easing of supply concerns; geopolitical volatility remains a premium driver. **(Moderate confidence)**

### Defense/Industrial
- **F‑35 sale to Saudi Arabia** signalled by U.S. administration. *Implication:* Potentially significant defence contracting volume; raises QME (qualitative military edge) debates. **(Moderate confidence)**

### Logistics/Transit
- **Polish rail sabotage** highlights vulnerability of Ukraine-adjacent supply routes. *Implication:* Elevated insurance and operational risk for rail-linked logistics chains into Ukraine. **(Moderate confidence)**
