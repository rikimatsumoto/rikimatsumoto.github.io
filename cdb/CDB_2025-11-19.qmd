## Lead Assessment

**Global markets enter risk-off mode as AI valuation concerns, yen weakness and Ukraine cease-fire rumours weigh.**

* Equity markets are under pressure: Asian shares fell, the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped ~1.2% ahead of major earnings from Nvidia. ([Reuters][1])
* The Japanese yen hit a 10-month low, with the government signalling market intervention may be required. ([Reuters][2])
* Oil prices plunged after reports of a U.S. proposal to end the Russia‑Ukraine War and persistent global oversupply concerns. ([Reuters][3])
  **We assess** that market sentiment is fragile and a negative catalyst is likely to trigger broader risk assets correction. **(Moderate-High confidence)**

---

## Regional Spotlights

### Levant / Israel–Lebanon

* **Situation:** Israeli airstrikes targeted the Lebanese town of Sidon (Palestinian refugee-camp adjacent) killing 13 individuals according to Lebanese ministry. ([Reuters][4])
* **Assessment:** Israel is re-escalating strikes in southern Lebanon likely to degrade Hezbollah capabilities. Risk of spill-over into border towns or merchant shipping routes remains elevated. **(Moderate confidence)**
* **Indicators to watch:** Additional evacuation warnings by IDF, Hezbollah retaliatory mortar/rocket fire, LAF/UNIFIL operational statements.

---

### Black Sea / Ukraine

* **Situation:** As per the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian forces continue attempts to encircle the Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad area while simultaneously operating on multiple axes rather than focusing on a single breakthrough. ([Kyiv Post][5])
* **Assessment:** Russia’s strategy appears aimed at wearing Ukrainian forces down and worsening logistics/defence posture rather than rapid territorial gains. **(High confidence)**
* **Business/financial implications:** Damage to Ukrainian power/energy infrastructure and export routes remains a strong tail-risk for global grain supply and Black Sea shipping.
* **Indicators to watch:** Reports of Ukrainian grid outages, new port/rail strikes, commodity-grain price jumps.

---

### South China Sea / Philippines

* **Situation:** No confirmed major incident today. **(Low‐Moderate confidence)**
* **Assessment:** While kinetic risk remains low currently, the underlying structure of maritime tension persists; insurers and shippers remain on alert.
* **Indicators to watch:** PCG/PN vessel harassment, Chinese coast guard resupply escort changes, cargo lane detours.

---

### Latin America / Venezuela

* **Situation:** A report by ECLAC shows trade in Latin America and the Caribbean is projected to grow ~5% in 2025 despite U.S. tariff pressure. ([Reuters][6])
* **Assessment:** This resilience suggests regional supply chains may be adapting to U.S. policy headwinds, reducing one macro risk factor. However, Venezuela remains vulnerable to sanctions/energy-flow shocks. **(Moderate confidence)**
* **Business relevance:** Energy and shipping exposures in Venezuela remain latent; export growth in broader Latin America continues to create trade-flow opportunities.

---

### Africa / Sahel–Horn–Sudan

* **Situation:** No major new headline military or humanitarian event reported today. **(Low confidence)**
* **Assessment:** While acute escalation is not visible today, the durability of aid/logistics corridors remains a structural business risk.
* **Indicators to watch:** Major RSF/SAF troop movements, humanitarian agency statements on corridor access, major border-closure announcements.

## Watch Items (24-72 h)

1. **Nvidia earnings and AI valuation reset** – outcome may reset tech market sentiment.
2. **JPY interventions / global FX shock** – rapid yen move could drag global risk assets.
3. **Ukraine cease-fire rumour flow** – U.S. proposal may alter conflict dynamics and commodity pricing.
4. **Israel-Lebanon escalation** – new strikes or Hezbollah retaliation could impact shipping & insurance in Eastern Med.
5. **Latin America trade shift** – ECLAC update signals structural trade resilience despite tariffs; watch logistics/port stocks.

## Annex — Business & Financial Indicators

### Macro & Markets

* Tech stocks and small-cap breadth under pressure; risk assets appear stretched. ([Reuters][7])
* **Assessment:** Without a positive trigger, markets may drift lower; hedge positioning and risk-premium widening likely. **(Moderate confidence)**

### Energy & Resources

* Oil jumped initially but fell ~2.6% after U.S. cease-fire proposal and supply concerns. ([Reuters][3])
* **Assessment:** While supply disruption risk remains, near term is dominated by demand softness and policy signals. **(Moderate confidence)**

### Defense / Industrial Base

* No new major arms-deal announced publicly today. **(Low confidence)**
* **Assessment:** Defence/industrial equities may be less sensitive today, but conflict theatres (Ukraine, Levant) continue to offer longer-term contract visibility.

---

### Notes on Confidence

* **High confidence:** Multiple independent sources, consistent indicators.
* **Moderate confidence:** Good sources yet incomplete picture or rapidly evolving.
* **Low confidence:** Fragmentary, single-source, or limited visibility.
