# **Executive Summary**

Open-source (OSINT) indicates a persistent, though fragmented, presence of **Israeli organised criminal elements** across Thailand, the Philippines, and adjacent Southeast Asian jurisdictions. These groups operate primarily through financially motivated cyber‑fraud schemes and, in limited cases, violent activity linked to intra‑Israeli organised crime (OC) rivalries. Their structure is characterised by **non-hierarchical, cell-based formations**, small leadership cadres, and cross-border mobility.

Key findings:

- Activity concentrated in **tourism and expatriate hubs**, including Bangkok, Koh Samui, Phuket, Angeles City, and Clark Freeport.
- Cyber-enabled fraud crews rely on **call-centre infrastructures**, front companies, and cryptocurrency/money‑service intermediaries.
- Violent incidents largely correspond to **internal OC disputes**, not targeted activity against host-nation populations.
- Groups operate as a **minor component** within far larger regional ecosystems dominated by Chinese, Nigerian, Cambodian, and Eastern European syndicates.

# **Analytical Overview**

Assessment:

- **Threat Vector:** Predominantly financial fraud; secondary risk from criminal-on-criminal violence.
- **Capability:** Moderate in cyber-fraud execution; limited in physical footprint.
- **Intent:** Revenue generation; evasion of Israeli and host-nation law enforcement.
- **Opportunity:** Visa flexibility, permissive regulatory environments, and the anonymity of tourism flows.
- **Vulnerability:** High exposure to immigration monitoring and multi-agency cybercrime taskforces.

**Regional Nodes of Concern:**

- **Thailand:** Bangkok (transit, logistics), Koh Samui and Phuket (safehaven, nightlife-linked facilitation), occasional violent OC spillover.
- **Philippines:** Clark Freeport and Angeles City (large cyber-fraud compounds), Manila (transit and identity services).
- **Greater Mekong Ecosystem (GME):** While Israeli crews are not major actors in scam compounds in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, the infrastructure indirectly **enables Israeli-linked fraud networks**.

# **Leadership Profiles (Roster Cards)**

## **1. Maor Israel Malul**

- **Linkages:** Connected to Malul homicide case  

---

## **3. Dolev Zuarez**  
**Role:** OC-linked suspect  
**Status:** Arrested in connection with the Malul case  
**Assessment:**  
- **Capability:** Demonstrated operational mobility  
- **Intent:** Unknown; likely tied to intra‑OC enforcement  

---

---

## **6. Osher Farhi**  
**Role:** Fugitive offender  
**Area:** Thailand  
**Status:** Arrested (2025)  
**Assessment:**  
- **Threat:** Low to moderate (mostly domestic offences in Israel)  
- **Relevance:** Illustrates Israel–Thailand extradition cooperation  

---

# **Modus Operandi Assessment**

**Fraud Operations:**  
- Use of **leased office space**, 24/7 “boiler-room” style operations.  
- Tied to **crypto payment processing**, fake brokerage platforms, and high‑pressure investor solicitation.  
- Target demographic: Western, East Asian, and Middle Eastern investors.

**Violence Patterns:**  
- Not directed at host populations; instead **OC-internal targeted violence**.  
- Thailand is preferred due to:  
  - High tourist footfall  
  - Mobility and concealment opportunities  
  - Access to disposable local facilitators  

**Enablement Factors:**  
- Corruption vulnerabilities in local law enforcement  
- Ease of identity changes and visa overstays  
- Expat communities with existing Israeli presence for cover and logistics  

---

# **Country Annexes**

## **Thailand Annex**

**Operational Environment:**  
Tourism-heavy, permissive for illicit logistics; high law enforcement presence but uneven capability.

**Israeli Presence:**  
- Mostly transient; nodes in Bangkok, Koh Samui, and Phuket.  
- Violent incidents limited but high-profile.

**Judgement:**  
- **Threat Level:** Moderate (fraud), Low–Moderate (violence)  
- **Indicators to Monitor:**  
  - Unregistered call-centre activity  
  - Sudden appearance of Israeli nationals with organised crime backgrounds  
  - Coordinated entry/exit patterns at Samui Airport

---

## **Philippines Annex**

**Operational Environment:**  
Clark Freeport and Angeles City remain hotspots for cyber-fraud compounds exploiting lax oversight.

**Israeli Presence:**  
- Documented leadership roles in 2018 mega-raid.  
- Recurring fugitive arrests in 2024–2025 period.

**Judgement:**  
- **Threat Level:** High (fraud), Low (violence)  
- **Indicators:**  
  - Israeli nationals leasing large commercial spaces  
  - Links to Israeli-run “consulting firms”  
  - Cryptocurrency-heavy remittance channels

---

## **Cambodia–Laos–Myanmar (GME) Annex**

While Israeli groups do **not** dominate these regions, the infrastructure of Chinese-led scam compounds **enables** Israeli-linked operations by:

- Offering offshore laundering channels  
- Selling spoofed platform access  
- Providing trafficked IT labour (in some cases)

**Threat Level:** Indirect.

---

# **Overall Assessment**

- Israeli OC activity in Southeast Asia remains **fragmented, opportunistic, and financially oriented**.
- Groups lack the size or territorial control of major regional syndicates but demonstrate **high adaptability**.
- Violence is **sporadic** and largely confined to internal OC discipline.
- States with high tourism and variable regulatory environments remain **prime targets for future operations**.
