# Executive Summary

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) indicates a **persistent and evolving presence of West African, primarily Nigerian, organised criminal elements** operating across key Southeast Asian (SEA) jurisdictions. These actors feature most prominently in:

- **Cyber-enabled fraud** (romance scams, “romance baiting”, crypto-investment fraud); and  
- **Drug trafficking and street-level narcotics distribution** in tourist districts.

The activity profile is consistent with **loosely structured, cell-based formations** linked to larger **West African organised crime (OC) networks** such as the so‑called *Yahoo Boys* and confraternity-linked groups (e.g. Black Axe, Airlords, Supreme Eiye) known for online financial fraud and human-trafficking‑fuelled scam operations.[^interpol-finfraud][^yahoo-boys]

In the SEA theatre, West African groups represent a **minority share** of the overall criminal ecosystem (which is dominated by Chinese, local, and other regional syndicates), but they remain **disproportionately impactful** in cross-border romance and investment fraud targeting Europe, North America, and the Middle East.[^ijm-wired][^forbes-romance]

**Key Judgements:**

- **Threat Vector:** Primarily financial (online fraud); secondary physical threat from drug trafficking and associated violence.
- **Capability:** Moderate in cyber-fraud; low to moderate in territorial control. High adaptability and cross-border mobility.
- **Intent:** Revenue generation; exploitation of weak oversight in tourism hubs; evasion of African and SEA law enforcement.
- **Opportunity:** Visa regimes, porous borders, scam-compound infrastructure, and demand for narcotics in nightlife districts.
- **Vulnerability:** Increasingly exposed to **multi-agency operations** (INTERPOL-led financial-fraud crackdowns; SEA scam-centre raids).

# Analytical Overview

## Organisational Typology

West African OC activity in SEA can be grouped into three broad types:

1. **Romance / Investment Fraud Cells**  
   - Malaysia-based Nigerian romance-scam syndicates that recruit **Singaporean and regional money mules** to channel proceeds.[^spf-cybercupid][^st-awolola]  
   - Off-shore “Yahoo Boy” crews using SEA as a logistics node or temporary base while targeting victims overseas.[^yahoo-boys][^interpol-finfraud]

2. **Drug-Trafficking Cells in Tourist Districts**  
   - Nigerian nationals arrested in **Bangkok’s Nana entertainment district** for cocaine distribution using “spit-and-swallow” concealment techniques.[^khaosod-nana]  
   - Individual West African traffickers using body-packing/swallowing methods to move cocaine into Thailand and neighbouring states.[^khaosod-nana]

3. **Embedded Actors in Scam Compounds**  
   - Investigations into **scam compounds in Cambodia and wider SEA** identify victims and operators from West Africa among multi‑national workforces coerced to run on‑line scams.[^ijm-wired][^interpol-finfraud]  
   - These actors may have direct or indirect ties to West African OC networks, but OSINT rarely attributes specific SEA sites to named confraternities.

## Regional Context

- **Southeast Asia** has emerged as the **global focal point for “romance baiting” scam operations**, with compound-style call centres using trafficked labour to run long‑con romance‑investment fraud.[^interpol-finfraud][^forbes-romance]
- **West African criminal groups** (including Black Axe, Airlords, Supreme Eiye) are explicitly identified by INTERPOL as key players in **online financial fraud**, especially romance and investment schemes.[^interpol-finfraud][^interpol-jackal]
- While much of their infrastructure remains in **West Africa**, the **global distribution of victims and money flows** creates strong incentives to utilise **off-shore nodes** in Asia for payments, crypto off‑ramps, and operational cover.

---

## 3. West African Financial-Fraud Networks (Black Axe, Airlords, Supreme Eiye)

- **Nationality:** Predominantly Nigerian and broader West African membership.  
- **Assessed Role:** Core **West African organised crime groups** involved in online financial fraud globally.[^interpol-finfraud][^interpol-jackal]  
- **Relevance to SEA:**  
  - INTERPOL notes these groups’ **transnational expansion** and **extensive skills in romance, investment, and crypto fraud**.  
  - SEA-based **romance-baiting call centres** represent a logical offshore vector for such networks, but specific attribution of SEA sites to named confraternities is typically restricted to law-enforcement channels.

**Threat Assessment:**

- **Capability:** High – structured networks with global reach, diversified fraud typologies, and money-laundering capacity.  
- **Intent:** Systematic exploitation of global victims via technology and human-trafficking‑based call-centre models.

# Modus Operandi Analysis

## Cyber-Fraud & Romance Baiting

- **Techniques:**  
  - Long‑term cultivation of on-line romantic relationships, often via social media and messaging apps.  
  - Transition from emotional grooming to **investment pitches** in crypto or FX, or requests for emergency funds.  
  - Use of **front companies, shell accounts, and mules** in SEA (e.g. Singapore, Malaysia) to launder proceeds.[^spf-cybercupid][^forbes-romance]

- **Infrastructure:**  
  - Call‑centre style “scam compounds” in Cambodia and neighbouring states, often run by Chinese OC but with **multi-national staff including West Africans**.[^ijm-wired][^ap-cambodia]  
  - Data from INTERPOL and NGOs highlights the use of **trafficked workers** forced into scam operations, blurring lines between victim and offender.[^interpol-finfraud][^ijm-wired]

## Drug Trafficking

- **Vector:** Air travel into SEA hubs (Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur), with body‑packing and ingesting/wrapping of cocaine prior to flights.[^khaosod-nana]  
- **Retail Model:**  
  - Small, mobile teams concentrate in **entertainment zones** (e.g. Nana district).  
  - Sales directed at foreign tourists; local populations and anyone resembling police are deliberately avoided.  
  - Evidence-destruction tactics (swallowing drug packets) deployed upon detection.

---

# Country Annexes

## Thailand Annex

**Operational Environment:**

- Major aviation hub and tourism destination with vibrant nightlife districts.
- Longstanding narcotics demand in tourist areas (Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya, Koh Samui).

**West African Presence:**

- Repeated arrests of Nigerian nationals for **cocaine trafficking** in Nana district and other nightlife nodes.[^khaosod-nana]  
- Occasional involvement of other African nationals (e.g. Cameroonian traffickers) in related drug cases in Bangkok.[^khaosod-nana]

**Judgement:**

- **Threat Level:**  
  - Fraud: Moderate (Thailand more often a transit/location hub than operational HQ).  
  - Drugs: Moderate in specific nightlife micro‑environments.  
- **Indicators to Monitor:**  
  - Clusters of West African nationals in nightlife zones with repeated narcotics arrests.  
  - Body-packing routes from West Africa or Europe via Middle Eastern hubs into Bangkok.  
  - Use of Thai associates to provide vehicles, accommodation, or document support.

---

## Malaysia / Singapore Annex

**Operational Environment:**

- Malaysia: Historically tolerant of foreign workforce and business migration, with large urban centres and on‑line infrastructure.  
- Singapore: Highly regulated, but attractive as a financial and payments hub with dense banking infrastructure.

**West African Presence:**

- **Malaysia-based Nigerian love scam syndicates** targeting victims in Singapore, Canada, and Macau, with **Singaporean money mules** recruited through romantic relationships.[^spf-cybercupid][^st-awolola][^cna-awolola]  
- Singaporean courts document **multi‑victim laundering of romance-scam proceeds** linked to Nigerian organisers.

**Judgement:**

- **Threat Level:**  
  - Fraud: High in terms of financial exposure, though absolute numbers of West African actors are relatively small.  
  - Drugs: Lower visibility compared with Thailand.  
- **Indicators:**  
  - Malaysian commercial spaces being used as informal call centres or on‑line “consultancies” run by foreign nationals.  
  - Singaporean accounts receiving large flows from romance-scam source countries, followed by couriering to Malaysia.  
  - Cross‑border romantic relationships followed by mule recruitment.

---

## Cambodia / Wider Scam-Compound Ecosystem Annex

**Operational Environment:**

- Cambodia (and parts of Laos / Myanmar) host **large scam compounds** operated mostly by Chinese and regional OC groups, using trafficked workers to conduct online fraud on an industrial scale.[^ap-cambodia][^ijm-wired]

**West African Presence:**

- International NGOs and investigative reporting note **West African victims and operators** present within these compounds, albeit as a minority compared with Asian nationals.[^ijm-wired]  
- These individuals may be directly connected to West African fraud networks or opportunistic actors drawn into the wider scam economy.

**Judgement:**

- **Threat Level:**  
  - Fraud: Very high at system level; West African share modest but operationally significant within global networks.  
  - Human Security: High, given the trafficking and coercion component.  
- **Indicators:**  
  - Identification of West African nationals among rescued or arrested scam workers.  
  - Financial flows from SEA scam hubs to West African banks or crypto addresses.

# Overall Assessment

1. **West African gangs in SEA are best understood as “nodes” of larger transnational financial-crime ecosystems** rather than stand‑alone territorial mafias.  
2. **Cyber-fraud and romance-baiting remain the primary threat vector**, with SEA hosting physical infrastructure (compounds, offices, logistics) and West Africa providing skilled labour and scripts (formats).  
3. **Drug trafficking** by West African groups is locally significant in specific nightlife hotspots, but dwarfed in volume by regional narcotics syndicates.  
4. Law-enforcement operations in both **Africa (e.g. Operation Jackal) and SEA (scam-centre raids)** are increasingly coordinated, shrinking safe havens but also incentivising further geographic diversification.

**Policy/Operational Implications:**

- **Intelligence Fusion:** Prioritise shared targeting packages combining **INTERPOL, ASEAN, and African** partners for West African financial-crime networks using SEA nodes.  
- **Financial Intelligence:** Enhance **payments and crypto monitoring** for flows that triangulate between SEA, West Africa, and victim geographies (EU, US, UK).  
- **Human Trafficking Lens:** Treat scam compounds and some West African actors as a **hybrid trafficked/perpetrator population**, balancing disruption with victim protection.  
- **Targeted Policing in Tourism Hubs:** Focus undercover and overt patrols in nightlife zones like Nana (Bangkok) where West African drug cells have been documented.
