## Lead Assessment


**New-year security posture remains tense but controlled; sanctions enforcement, maritime risk, and winter operations continue to frame the global risk environment.**

- Sanctions enforcement against Venezuelan crude exports and Russian logistics continues into the new year, sustaining elevated compliance, freight, and insurance costs.
- Russia–Ukraine winter operations persist with emphasis on infrastructure pressure rather than manoeuvre warfare.
- Escalation risk remains contained at present, but thin holiday liquidity and reduced diplomatic bandwidth elevate the impact of any discrete shock. **Confidence: Moderate.**

## Regional Spotlights

### Levant | Israel–Lebanon

- **Situation:** No confirmed major kinetic incidents overnight; force posture and rhetoric remain escalatory but bounded.
- **Assessment:** Israel is likely to maintain precision disruption operations; Hezbollah responses, if any, are likely to remain limited and deniable.
**Confidence: Moderate.**

### Black Sea | Ukraine–Russia

- **Situation:** Winter strike patterns continue; both sides prioritise energy and logistics targets.
- **Assessment:** Further long-range strikes are **likely**; a decisive battlefield shift remains **unlikely** in the near term.
- **Business implications:** Persistent war-risk premia for Black Sea shipping; continued volatility for grain, fertiliser, and energy logistics.
**Confidence: High (trend).**

### Indo-Pacific | South China Sea / Philippines

- **Situation:** No new reported clashes; routine patrols ongoing.
- **Assessment:** Structural miscalculation risk persists due to close-quarters enforcement; serious escalation remains **unlikely** absent collision.
**Confidence: Low–Moderate.**

### Latin America | Venezuela

- **Situation:** Export constraints persist as PDVSA adapts via rerouting, intermediaries, and ship-to-ship transfers.
- **Assessment:** Sanctions enforcement likely remains firm into Q1 2026, sustaining high compliance risk for traders and insurers.
**Confidence: High.**

### Africa | Sahel–Horn–Sudan

- **Situation:** No breakthrough on mediation; humanitarian access remains constrained.
- **Assessment:** External pressure insufficient to alter battlefield incentives; localised violence remains **likely**.
**Confidence: Low–Moderate.**

## Watch Items (Next 24–72 hours)

1. **Maritime incidents** affecting sanctioned trade (Venezuela, Black Sea).  
2. **Ukraine infrastructure strikes** during holiday-period diplomatic lull.  
3. **Israel–Lebanon probe-and-response events** testing escalation thresholds.  
4. **South China Sea close-quarters encounters** involving fishing or patrol vessels.  
5. **Market liquidity stress** amplifying reactions to otherwise contained events.

## Annex — Business & Financial Indicators & Implications

### Energy & Commodities

- Physical supply remains adequate, but **logistics, insurance, and compliance costs** remain elevated.
- **Assessment:** Price volatility more likely from discrete geopolitical shocks than fundamentals.
**Confidence: Moderate.**

### Shipping & Insurance

- War-risk premia remain elevated across Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean corridors.
- Rerouting and seasonal crew constraints increase operational friction.
**Confidence: High.**

### Macro Context (IMF)

- IMF downside risks—fragmentation, conflict, transport chokepoints—remain salient entering 2026.
- **Assessment:** Current conditions align with a low-growth, high-volatility tail-risk environment.
**Confidence: High.**
