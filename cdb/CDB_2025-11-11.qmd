# Lead

## Levant — Israel–Lebanon: Precision strikes and pressure track

**What changed (last 24–72h):** Israel sustained **targeted airstrikes** in southern Lebanon after evacuation alerts, while debate intensified over **Lebanese Army searches for Hezbollah arms** under the truce framework. UNIFIL reiterated Blue Line compliance concerns.  
**Assessment:** Further **calibrated strike packages** are **likely** over the next 72h, with Hezbollah maintaining bounded retaliation below full-war thresholds. *Escalation risk elevated but contained.* **(Confidence: moderate.)**

*Key sourcing:* Reuters (Nov 6 & Nov 10, 2025); UNIFIL statements.

# Regional Spotlights *(only theatres with credible new developments in the last 24–72h)*

## Levant / Israel–Lebanon
- **Operational tempo:** Reuters reports Israeli strikes in south Lebanon after evacuation warnings (Aita al‑Jabal, Al‑Tayyiba, Tayr Debba and others). UNIFIL flags continued 1701 compliance issues. **(Confidence: moderate–high.)**  
- **Policy pressure:** Israel has pressed the **Lebanese Army** to search more intrusively for Hezbollah arms; Lebanese leadership resists amid civil‑strife concerns. **(Confidence: moderate.)**  

**Why it matters for business/finance:** East‑Med **war‑risk premiums** and selective **rerouting** remain in play for the week; monitor insurer circulars and port advisories.

*Sources:* Reuters, UNIFIL (Nov 6–11, 2025).

---

## Black Sea / Ukraine
- **Frontline dynamics:** Russia claims **house‑to‑house** advances in **Pokrovsk**; Ukraine denies encirclement but acknowledges intense urban combat. **(Confidence: moderate.)**  
- **Infrastructure risk:** Elevated probability of **deep‑strike exchanges** against rail and power nodes through the week. **(Confidence: moderate.)**

**Why it matters:** Higher tail‑risk for **EU power/rail disruption** and **insurance** on Ukraine‑adjacent logistics; track outage notices and rail NOTAMs.

*Sources:* Reuters; Ukrinform; ISW (Nov 5–11, 2025).

---

## South China Sea / Philippines
- **Presence ops:** China’s military publicly **tracked/monitored Philippine‑led patrols**; allied coordination continues following the **Canada–Philippines SOVFA**. **(Confidence: high.)**  
- **Friction risk:** Expect continued **close‑quarters** interactions around resupply and fisheries protection near Scarborough/Spratlys. **(Confidence: moderate.)**

**Why it matters:** Potential **freight/insurance creep** and schedule variance on West Philippine Sea lanes; consider buffer time and alternate routings.

*Sources:* Reuters; Government of Canada; SCMP; Philippine Star (Nov 1–11, 2025).

---

## Latin America / Venezuela
- **Maritime interdictions:** The U.S. reported **additional lethal strikes** on suspected drug‑carrying vessels in the **Caribbean** (Nov 6) and **eastern Pacific** (Nov 10). **(Confidence: high.)**

**Why it matters:** Watch **tanker routing**, **AIS anomalies**, and **P&I circulars**; intermittent **day‑rate spikes** possible if incidents cluster regionally.

*Sources:* Reuters round‑ups (Oct–Nov 2025).

# Watch Items (Next 24–72h)

- **Blue Line (Levant):** More **pre‑announced precision strikes**; indicators: evacuation maps, UNIFIL patrol advisories, Hezbollah claim streams. **(Confidence: moderate.)**  
- **Pokrovsk AO (Ukraine):** **Street‑to‑street** fighting; indicators: geolocated footage, substation outage notices, rail NOTAMs. **(Confidence: moderate.)**  
- **West Philippine Sea:** **CCG massing / militia clustering** during allied patrols; indicators: PCG advisories, AIS dark clusters, PLAN PAOs. **(Confidence: moderate.)**  
- **Caribbean/Eastern Pacific:** Continued U.S. **maritime strikes**; indicators: DoD/PAO posts, insurer notices. **(Confidence: moderate.)**

# Indicators & Implications Annex (Business / Financial)

## Key Indicators to Watch

| Region / Issue | Indicator | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Israel–Lebanon | Strike frequency; UNIFIL/LAF enforcement; truce implementation text | **War‑risk pricing** and routing for East‑Med; port security advisories |
| Ukraine | Grid/rail disruption notices; urban control in Pokrovsk | **EU power volatility**; **supply‑chain delays** and insurer responses |
| South China Sea | CCG/PLAN proximity events; coalition patrol schedule | **Freight/insurance creep**; detention/demurrage risk |
| Caribbean/E. Pacific | Interdiction tempo; AIS spoofing clusters | **Crude/products flows**, liability exposure, day‑rate spikes |

## Near‑Term Business Actions (72h)
1. **Coverage check:** Validate **war‑risk riders** (East‑Med, West Philippine Sea) and sanctions/force‑majeure clauses.  
2. **Liquidity & hedging:** Scenario‑test **+20–30%** spot freight on SCS lanes and **+10–15%** EU power/gas on outage headlines.  
3. **Routing & buffers:** Pre‑plan alternate routings (Indonesia/Australia arcs; Atlantic alternatives) and **build buffer inventory** at vulnerable nodes.
