# Lead

## Israel–Lebanon: Precision IAF strikes continue as financial and diplomatic pressure intensifies

**What’s new (past 24–48h):** Israel maintained calibrated airstrikes against Hezbollah-linked infrastructure in southern Lebanon following civilian evacuation alerts. UNIFIL confirmed cross-border air activity near Tayr Dibbah and Ayta al Jabal. Simultaneously, the U.S. Treasury announced new sanctions targeting Hezbollah’s Iran-linked financial network. *(Confidence: moderate.)*

**Assessment:** Israel likely aims to degrade Hezbollah’s logistical depth without triggering an all-out war. Diplomatic condemnation will not deter Israel’s precision-strike posture in the near term. Persistent East-Med **war-risk premiums** are expected through midweek. *(Confidence: moderate.)*

*Cites:* Reuters, UNIFIL, AP (Nov 8–10, 2025).
