Here is today’s **CDB – Presidential-Style Daily Brief** (Saturday, 29 November 2025) — MI5/IC-style, global-scan, risk-alert format.

## Lead Assessment

**Russian drone-missile strikes on Kyiv plus Black Sea tanker-hits elevate risk premium — global energy and shipping markets jittery.**

* Overnight attacks on Kyiv by Russian drones and missiles killed at least one and injured 11, while jets and strikes caused widespread damage to residential buildings and grid infrastructure. ([Reuters][1])
* Simultaneously, two tankers linked to Russia’s “shadow fleet” were struck in the Black Sea — one reportedly by missiles or drones — re-igniting fears over maritime transport security and energy export supply lines. ([Al Arabiya English][2])
* **We assess** these events materially increase downside risk for global shipping throughput, energy markets, and grain/fertilizer export corridors over the next 24–72 hours. **(High confidence)**

## Regional Spotlights

### Eastern Europe / Russia–Ukraine & Black Sea

* **Situation:** Ukraine’s capital under renewed drone-missile assault; power outages reported for hundreds of thousands. ([Reuters][1])
* Russian-linked “shadow fleet” tankers hit in Black Sea — one reportedly loading at Novorossiysk, raising supply-chain and insurance disruption risk. ([Al Arabiya English][2])
* **Assessment:** Russia appears to be escalating pressure on both military and maritime-economic fronts — likely aiming to destabilize Ukrainian logistics and send a broader deterrence signal to energy and shipping markets. **(High confidence)**
* **Business/financial implications:** Elevated insurance premiums for Black Sea / Mediterranean shipping; supply-chain stress for grain, oil, and fertilizer exports; hedging and contingency plans should be activated by importers/traders.

---

### Middle East / Eastern Mediterranean — Israel & Lebanon

* **Situation:** As Western attention is diverted to Ukraine and Black Sea instability, the risk of temporary regional flare-ups remains latent — Hezbollah recently reaffirmed readiness to “set the timing” for retaliation. ([Reuters][3])
* No new confirmed strikes today, but the asymmetric warfare environment remains simmering, particularly relative to civil-security risk and maritime-shipping exposure in Eastern Mediterranean corridors.
* **Assessment:** While immediate kinetic escalation seems unlikely, the risk floor is elevated — especially for companies with exposure to offshore energy servicing, shipping lanes, or insurance coverage in the region. **(Moderate confidence)**

---

### Global Shipping & Trade Logistics

* **Situation:** Tanker-hits in Black Sea raise alarm across maritime insurance and shipping networks. Disruptions may ripple into global crude, fertiliser, and grain trade.
* **Assessment:** We judge short-term trade and logistics volatility will rise; alternate routing (circumnavigation, insurance-heavy corridors) may increase freight cost and delays. **(High confidence)**
* **Implications:** Shipping firms, insurers, commodity traders should pre-emptively adjust exposure, consider alternate sourcing/route planning, and increase risk buffers.

| 4        | Grain & fertiliser supply chain disruption via Ukraine/Black Sea                | Could drive commodity price volatility globally                              | Export-volume data, shipping-delays, futures market spikes                                |

## Annex — Business & Financial Indicators

### Energy & Commodities

* **Crude and oil-product shipments via Black Sea remain at high risk** — firms should re-evaluate delivery schedules and hold higher inventory buffers.
* **Fertiliser and grain export disruption risk remains elevated** — price volatility and availability bottlenecks likely for relevant importers/consumers.

### Shipping & Logistics

* Freight-cost pressure inbound: rising insurance premiums and possible route changes may increase operational cost base.
* For shipping operators and commodity traders: use of alternate routes, increased hedging, and client-notification protocols advisable.

### Geopolitical Risk & Insurance Markets

* Elevated regional and maritime risk will likely feed through to **insurance premia (hull, cargo, war-risk)** globally.
* Entities with exposure to dual-use commodities, global supply-chains, or assets in volatile theatres should re-assess risk posture and hedging strategies.

## Notes on Confidence

* **High confidence** — when multiple independent reputable sources report converging information (e.g. strikes, tanker-hits, asset damage).
* **Moderate confidence** — where signals are credible but uncertain or evolving (e.g. risk of Hezbollah provocation, regional spill-over).
* **Low confidence** — speculative or early-stage developments (e.g. maritime-route re-configuration, long-term sanction impact).
