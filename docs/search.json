    "text": "what I’ve (co-)written\n\n\n0.1 Benchmarking Human Capital Spending Efficiency Using Bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis\n\nI demonstrate how to conduct Bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and generate distributions of efficiency scores. I examine expenditures in health and education and cross-country variation in human capital and find large potential efficiency gains for developing countries.\n\n\n\n0.2 Back-of-Envelope Series: Estimating spending needs to meet SDG 2\n\nI started a new series called the “Back-of-Envelope” Policy Series, where I calculate (very) rough estimates of a policy issue that interests me. For the inaugural “Back-of-Envelope” note, I estimated costs to meet “minimum hunger and nutrition needs” under specific scenarios.\n\n\nThis rough estimate is intended to contribute to efforts within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030 (SDG 2) from a social protection perspective.\n\n\n\n0.3 (IMF Working Paper) Guaranteed Minimum Income Schemes in Europe: Landscape and Design\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the design of means-tested Guaranteed Minimum Income schemes, which constitute an important component of social protection systems in European countries. It discusses how key design features differ across countries, including how countries balance the primary objective of poverty alleviation against the desire to both manage the work disincentives inherent in such programs and contain fiscal cost.\n\n\n\n0.4 (IMF Working Paper) Challenges Facing SSNs in Emerging and Developing Economies\n\nWe show how the standard social welfare framework can be used to assess the performance of social safety nets (SSNs) in terms of targeting efficiency and budget effort. We apply this framework to the World Bank’s ASPIRE database and find that the variation in poverty alleviation achieved by SSNs in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is driven mainly by variation in budget effort. Increasing transfer spending is therefore key to strengthening SSNs in EMDEs."

    "text": "What’s new (overnight): The Ukraine reported that the Russian Armed Forces launched dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones overnight, damaging major energy‑infrastructure in Kyiv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions, killing at least three civilians. Meanwhile, the Philippines issued life‑threatening storm surge warnings as Typhoon Fung‑wong (local name Uwan) expanded toward the east coast with super‑typhoon potential. In the U.S., Congress remains gridlocked in the longest government shutdown in history, with fiscal‑hawk Republicans proposing flat‑spending continuing resolutions. Assessment: The combination of high‑intensity infrastructure targeting in Ukraine, severe weather risk in the Philippines, and U.S. fiscal uncertainty significantly raises business and financial systemic risk in three distinct zones. The Ukraine strikes suggest Russia will continue winter‑era escalation to degrade Ukrainian resilience; we assess this as likely. Confidence: moderate‑high. The Philippine typhoon poses imminent operational and supply‑chain risk in the Indo‑Pacific. Confidence: high. The U.S. shutdown remains ongoing and may materially affect global markets and federal services. Confidence: moderate."

Their structure is characterised by non-hierarchical, cell-based formations, small leadership cadres, and cross-border mobility.\nKey findings:\n\nActivity concentrated in tourism and expatriate hubs, including Bangkok, Koh Samui, Phuket, Angeles City, and Clark Freeport.\nCyber-enabled fraud crews rely on call-centre infrastructures, front companies, and cryptocurrency/money‑service intermediaries.\nViolent incidents largely correspond to internal OC disputes, not targeted activity against host-nation populations.\nGroups operate as a minor component within far larger regional ecosystems dominated by Chinese, Nigerian, Cambodian, and Eastern European syndicates."

High adaptability and cross-border mobility.\nIntent: Revenue generation; exploitation of weak oversight in tourism hubs; evasion of African and SEA law enforcement.\nOpportunity: Visa regimes, porous borders, scam-compound infrastructure, and demand for narcotics in nightlife districts.\nVulnerability: Increasingly exposed to multi-agency operations (INTERPOL-led financial-fraud crackdowns; SEA scam-centre raids)."

    "text": "LinkedIn GitHub Analytics blog (Medium) \n\n\nhello! im riki!\n\n\nthis is a long-time coming but ive finally made a github pages… and it may be a long-time yet before this is fully fleshed out. In the meantime, here’s what you should know about me:\n\n\n00. Full-stack analytics with economic policy background. I’ve spent 5+ years as a full-stack research and data person across economics and international policy institutions. My responsibilities have included pure research, data engineering, modelling, and application development, in a variety of settings which has allowed me to see the integration of data in economic policy firsthand.\n\n\n01. I prototype, ship, and solve problems. I’ve engineered ETL pipelines from scratch to automate intake workflows and have built (too many) interactive dashboards analyzing data, including one on U.S. tariff and trade data. I currently lead an ML project that predicts farmer adoption rates of agricultural training using XGBoost, SHAP explainability, and R Shiny deployed for technical assistance teams.\n\n\n02. I like learning new things.  I try to continuously upskill in ML/AI tooling, and I’m learning more about scalable solutions. Most recently, I used LangChain + ChromaDB to build an LLM-based app that generates private-sector diagnostics for investment teams. Outside work, I do judo, volunteer in the DC Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), and am pursuing my amateur HAM radio technician license.\n\n\n03. I’m collaborative. At the end of the day, data analytics can’t be done in a silo. I like working in interdisciplinary teams, translating technical analysis into insights product managers and economists can act on. Whether it’s pairing with engineers to productionize a prototype application or brainstorming with project managers on dashboards, I always treat analytics as a team sport.\n\n\n\nWhat I’m thinking about right now:\n\n\nPoint metrics don’t tell you whether the model outputs align with the observed data distribution.\nI.e., if the model has a good (low) RMSE but predicts a noticeably different distribution, it might be overfitting the center and neglecting the tails. Distributional metrics help identify this.[image or embed]\n\n— riki (@rikimatsumoto.bsky.social) September 5, 2025 at 1:47 PM"

It’s quite “naive” in the sense that it models the income distribution of an entire country as ten shares. However, it helped me understand how redistribution directly impacts inequality metrics like the Gini coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3 U.S. Tariff & Trade tracker (Brookings)\n\nDuring the height of the tariff uncertainty in Q1/Q2 2025, I developed a tariff tracker with my wonderful colleagues.
