I examine expenditures in health and education and cross-country variation in human capital and find large potential efficiency gains for developing countries.\n\n\n\nBack-of-Envelope Series: Estimating spending needs to meet SDG 2\n\nI started a new series called the “Back-of-Envelope” Policy Series, where I calculate (very) rough estimates of a policy issue that interests me. For the inaugural “Back-of-Envelope” note, I estimated costs to meet “minimum hunger and nutrition needs” under specific scenarios.\n\n\nThis rough estimate is intended to contribute to efforts within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030 (SDG 2) from a social protection perspective.\n\n\n\n(IMF Working Paper) Guaranteed Minimum Income Schemes in Europe: Landscape and Design\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the design of means-tested Guaranteed Minimum Income schemes, which constitute an important component of social protection systems in European countries. It discusses how key design features differ across countries, including how countries balance the primary objective of poverty alleviation against the desire to both manage the work disincentives inherent in such programs and contain fiscal cost.\n\n\n\n(IMF Working Paper) Challenges Facing SSNs in Emerging and Developing Economies\n\nWe show how the standard social welfare framework can be used to assess the performance of social safety nets (SSNs) in terms of targeting efficiency and budget effort. We apply this framework to the World Bank’s ASPIRE database and find that the variation in poverty alleviation achieved by SSNs in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is driven mainly by variation in budget effort. Increasing transfer spending is therefore key to strengthening SSNs in EMDEs."

    "text": "hello! here are some of the projects I’ve worked on.\n\n\nU.S. Federal Expenditure tracker (Brookings)\n\nFor some interesting work I did with some colleagues (s/o Noadia + Lauren), check out this R Shiny app on U.S. Federal Outlays (spending)\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial spending mini-simulation\n\nI created this simple mini-simulation to visualize how redistribution through social spending works. It’s quite “naive” in the sense that it models the income distribution of an entire country as ten shares. However, it helped me understand how redistribution directly impacts inequality metrics like the Gini coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Tariff & Trade tracker (Brookings)\n\nDuring the height of the tariff uncertainty in Q1/Q2 2025, I developed a tariff tracker with my wonderful colleagues. Check it out!"

    "text": "LinkedIn GitHub Analytics blog (Medium)\n\n\nhello! im riki!\n\n\nthis is a long-time coming but ive finally made a github pages… and it may be a long-time yet before this is fully fleshed out. In the meantime, here’s what you should know about me:\n\n\n00. Full-stack analytics with a unique perspective in economics. I’ve spent 4-5 years as a full-stack research and data person in a variety of settings which has allowed me to see the integration of data in economics firsthand.\n\n\n01. I solve problems. I’ve developed ETL processes from scratch to streamline intake as a data engineer. I’ve also created data visualisations analyzing U.S. tariff and trade data. I’m always looking for creative solutions to problems and more efficient ways to accomplish tasks.\n\n\n02. I’m constantly learning new things. I have certifications in data engineering topics and I’m learning more about MLOps. I’m often reading new research papers on AI and data science to keep up with the fast process of innovation and potential applicability to my work. Most recently, I experimented with Langchain to make an LLM web application to support foreign investment research. Beyond data, I’m also taking classes in judo, I’ve trained with the D.C. Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) and looking to become licensed as a radio HAM.\n\n\n03. I’m detail-oriented, creative, and inspired. I want to use data to answer critical operational questions and offer actionable insights. I currently oversee an MLOps project to support agricultural training for farmers in the international development space.\n\n\n04. I’m collaborative. At the end of the day, data analytics can’t be done in a silo. I understand my own expertise and the expertise of my team; Working in cross-functional roles is my favourite strategy to collaborate on new analytics solutions."
