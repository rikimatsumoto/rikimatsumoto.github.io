    "text": "what I’ve (co-)written\n\n\n0.1 Benchmarking Human Capital Spending Efficiency Using Bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis\n\nI demonstrate how to conduct Bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and generate distributions of efficiency scores. I examine expenditures in health and education and cross-country variation in human capital and find large potential efficiency gains for developing countries.\n\n\n\n0.2 Back-of-Envelope Series: Estimating spending needs to meet SDG 2\n\nI started a new series called the “Back-of-Envelope” Policy Series, where I calculate (very) rough estimates of a policy issue that interests me. For the inaugural “Back-of-Envelope” note, I estimated costs to meet “minimum hunger and nutrition needs” under specific scenarios.\n\n\nThis rough estimate is intended to contribute to efforts within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030 (SDG 2) from a social protection perspective.\n\n\n\n0.3 (IMF Working Paper) Guaranteed Minimum Income Schemes in Europe: Landscape and Design\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the design of means-tested Guaranteed Minimum Income schemes, which constitute an important component of social protection systems in European countries. It discusses how key design features differ across countries, including how countries balance the primary objective of poverty alleviation against the desire to both manage the work disincentives inherent in such programs and contain fiscal cost.\n\n\n\n0.4 (IMF Working Paper) Challenges Facing SSNs in Emerging and Developing Economies\n\nWe show how the standard social welfare framework can be used to assess the performance of social safety nets (SSNs) in terms of targeting efficiency and budget effort. We apply this framework to the World Bank’s ASPIRE database and find that the variation in poverty alleviation achieved by SSNs in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is driven mainly by variation in budget effort. Increasing transfer spending is therefore key to strengthening SSNs in EMDEs."

It’s quite “naive” in the sense that it models the income distribution of an entire country as ten shares. However, it helped me understand how redistribution directly impacts inequality metrics like the Gini coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3 U.S. Tariff & Trade tracker (Brookings)\n\nDuring the height of the tariff uncertainty in Q1/Q2 2025, I developed a tariff tracker with my wonderful colleagues. Check it out!"

    "text": "LinkedIn GitHub Analytics blog (Medium) \n\n\nhello! im riki!\n\n\nthis is a long-time coming but ive finally made a github pages… and it may be a long-time yet before this is fully fleshed out. In the meantime, here’s what you should know about me:\n\n\n00. Full-stack analytics with economic policy background. I’ve spent 5+ years as a full-stack research and data person across economics and international policy institutions. My responsibilities have included pure research, data engineering, modelling, and application development, in a variety of settings which has allowed me to see the integration of data in economic policy firsthand.\n\n\n01. I prototype, ship, and solve problems. I’ve engineered ETL pipelines from scratch to automate intake workflows and have built (too many) interactive dashboards analyzing data, including one on U.S. tariff and trade data. I currently lead an ML project that predicts farmer adoption rates of agricultural training using XGBoost, SHAP explainability, and R Shiny deployed for technical assistance teams.\n\n\n02. I like learning new things.  I try to continuously upskill in ML/AI tooling, and I’m learning more about scalable solutions. Most recently, I used LangChain + ChromaDB to build an LLM-based app that generates private-sector diagnostics for investment teams. Outside work, I do judo, volunteer in the DC Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), and am pursuing my amateur HAM radio technician license.\n\n\n03. I’m collaborative. At the end of the day, data analytics can’t be done in a silo. I like working in interdisciplinary teams, translating technical analysis into insights product managers and economists can act on. Whether it’s pairing with engineers to productionize a prototype application or brainstorming with project managers on dashboards, I always treat analytics as a team sport."
