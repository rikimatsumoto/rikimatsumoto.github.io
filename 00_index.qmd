  <h2>hello! im riki!  </h2>

  <p>this is a long-time coming but ive finally made a github pages... and it may be a long-time yet before this is fully fleshed out. In the meantime, here's what you should know about me:</p>

  <p><strong>00. Full-stack analytics with economic policy background.</strong><br>
  I’ve spent 5+ years as a full-stack research and data person across economics and international policy institutions. My responsibilities have included pure research, data engineering, modelling, and application development, in a variety of settings which has allowed me to see the integration of data in economic policy firsthand.</p>

  <p><strong>01. I prototype, ship, and solve problems.</strong><br>
  I’ve engineered ETL pipelines from scratch to automate intake workflows and have built (too many) interactive dashboards analyzing data, including one on U.S. tariff and trade data. I currently lead an ML project that predicts farmer adoption rates of agricultural training using XGBoost, SHAP explainability, and R Shiny deployed for technical assistance teams.</p>

  <p><strong>02. I like learning new things. </strong><br>
  I try to continuously upskill in ML/AI tooling, and I'm learning more about scalable solutions. Most recently, I used LangChain + ChromaDB to build an LLM-based app that generates private-sector diagnostics for investment teams. Outside work, I do judo, volunteer in the DC Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), and am pursuing my amateur HAM radio technician license.</p>
  
  <p><strong>03. I’m collaborative.</strong><br>
  At the end of the day, data analytics can't be done in a silo. I like working in interdisciplinary teams, translating technical analysis into insights product managers and economists can act on. Whether it's pairing with engineers to productionize a prototype application or brainstorming with project managers on dashboards, I always treat analytics as a team sport. </p>

#### What I'm thinking about right now:

I.e., if the model has a good (low) RMSE but predicts a noticeably different distribution, it might be overfitting the center and neglecting the tails. Distributional metrics help identify this.<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2/post/3ly47s3k3uc2g?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; riki (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2?ref_src=embed">@rikimatsumoto.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2/post/3ly47s3k3uc2g?ref_src=embed">September 5, 2025 at 1:47 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
