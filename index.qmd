  <h2>hello! im riki!  </h2>

  <p>this is a long-time coming but ive finally made a github pages... and it may be a long-time yet before this is fully fleshed out. In the meantime, here's what you should know about me:</p>

  <p><strong>00. Full-stack analytics with economic policy background.</strong><br>
  I’ve spent 5+ years as a full-stack research and data person across economics and international policy institutions. My responsibilities have ranged from purely academic research to analytical product development in various settings, giving me firsthand experience with data integration in economic policy.</p>

  <p><strong>01. I prototype, ship, and solve analytic problems.</strong><br>
  I've designed, built, and deployed full analytic pipelines — from data engineering and modeling to machine-learning interpretability, dashboarding, and automated reporting. I've probably created *too many* analytics web applications for teams. Currently, I lead an ML project that predicts farmers' adoption rates of agricultural training using XGBoost, SHAP explainability, and R Shiny, deployed for project teams.</p>

  <p><strong>02. I like learning new things. </strong><br>
  I try to continuously upskill in ML/AI tooling, and I'm learning more about scalable solutions. I used LangChain + ChromaDB to build an LLM-based app that generates private-sector diagnostics for investment teams. Most recently, I wrote an [essay about how camera resolution and distance affects facial recognition accuracy](https://rikimatsumoto.github.io/essay/essay_2025-12-01.html). Outside work, I do judo, volunteer in the DC Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), and am pursuing my amateur HAM radio technician license.</p>

#### What I'm thinking about right now:

I.e., if the model has a good (low) RMSE but predicts a noticeably different distribution, it might be overfitting the center and neglecting the tails. Distributional metrics help identify this.<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2/post/3ly47s3k3uc2g?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; riki (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2?ref_src=embed">@rikimatsumoto.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2/post/3ly47s3k3uc2g?ref_src=embed">September 5, 2025 at 1:47 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
