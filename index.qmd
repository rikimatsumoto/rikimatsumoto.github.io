  <h2>hello! im riki!  </h2>

  <p>here's what you should know about me:</p>

  <p><strong>00. Full-stack analytics with economic policy background.</strong><br>
  I have a Master's in analytics from Georgia Tech and am a former IMF research analyst. I’ve spent 5+ years as a full-stack research and data person across economics and international policy institutions. Currently, I lead an ML project that predicts farmers' adoption rates of agricultural training deployed for project teams.</p>

  <p><strong>01. I prototype, ship, and solve analytic problems.</strong><br>
  I've designed, built, and deployed full analytic pipelines, from data pipelines and modeling to machine-learning interpretability, dashboarding, and automated reporting.</p>

  <p><strong>02. I like learning new things. </strong><br>
  I try to continuously upskill in ML/AI tooling, and I'm learning more about scalable solutions. Previously, I used LangChain + ChromaDB to build an LLM-based app that assessed foreign investment suitability. Most recently, I wrote an [essay about how camera resolution and distance affect facial recognition accuracy](https://rikimatsumoto.github.io/essay/essay_2025-12-01.html). Outside work, I do judo, volunteer in the DC Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), and am pursuing my amateur HAM radio technician license.</p>

I.e., if the model has a good (low) RMSE but predicts a noticeably different distribution, it might be overfitting the center and neglecting the tails. Distributional metrics help identify this.<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2/post/3ly47s3k3uc2g?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; riki (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2?ref_src=embed">@rikimatsumoto.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c2pjvazhh5txx57qt6jluvb2/post/3ly47s3k3uc2g?ref_src=embed">September 5, 2025 at 1:47 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
