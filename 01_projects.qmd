<h2>hello! here are some of the projects I've worked on.</h2>

### U.S. Federal Expenditure tracker (Brookings)
  <p>For some interesting work I did with some colleagues (s/o Noadia + Lauren), check out this R Shiny app on U.S. Federal Outlays (spending)</p>

### Social spending mini-simulation
<p>I created this simple mini-simulation to visualize how redistribution through social spending works. It's quite "naive" in the sense that it models the income distribution of an entire country as ten shares. However, it helped me understand how redistribution directly impacts inequality metrics like the Gini coefficient.</p>
