## Menu!

### 1. **Side Dishes**
Classic sides!

- **Mashed bluish potatoes**  
  - Ingredients:  
    - 2 lb. medium Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed
    - 2 lb. medium Adirondack Blue potatoes, scrubbed
    - 4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
    - 1½ cups whole milk
    - ½ cup heavy cream
    - 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
    - 3 sprigs rosemary
    - 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces
    - Freshly ground black pepper
  - Prep/Assembly Instructions:
    - Place 4 lb. of potatoes, scrubbed, in a large pot and pour in cold water to cover by 1". Add a large handful of kosher salt (water should taste briny, like the ocean) and bring to a boil on the stovetop over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender (very tender but not crumbly, 30–35 minutes). Drain, briefly rinse with cool water to remove any excess starch, and return potatoes to warm pot (off heat) to dry while you heat the milk mixture.
    - Warm 1½ cups whole milk, ½ cup heavy cream, 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise, and 3 sprigs rosemary in a small saucepan over medium until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat.
    - Pass hot potatoes through ricer or food mill into a large bowl (cold potatoes will become gummy; ricer will catch potato skins, remove and discard as needed if they start to block grate). Add 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces, and 4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2½ tsp. Morton kosher salt and stir until butter is completely incorporated. Strain warm milk mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring glass. Pour into potatoes ½-cupful at a time, stirring after each addition until liquid is fully incorporated and mixture is smooth before adding more.
    - Serve mashed potatoes topped with a few grinds of freshly ground black pepper.
  - Notes: I used a modified version of the ["Our Best Ever Mashed Potatoes"](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-mashed-potatoes).

- **riki's pickled cabbage slaw**  
  - Ingredients:  
    - 1 lb of saurkraut
    - half a head of purple cabbage
    - dashi powder
    - mirin
    - brown sugar
    - fish sauce 
    - kewpie mayonnaise
    - Gochugaru (korean chilis)
  - Prep/Assembly Instructions:
    - Cut and dice the purple cabbage, then rinse a few times under cold water.
    - Pour the saurkraut into a pot, then gently warm. Pour the purple cabbage into the pot.
    - While the saurkraut and the purple cabbage are gently cooked, add brown sugar, dashi powder, mirin, fish sauce, and gochugaru to taste.
    - Once the purple cabbage is gently cooked, turn heat off and leave to cool. 
    - Add kewpie mayonnaise and serve!
  - Notes: a blend of Pennsylvania dutch cuisine (saurkraut), and Thai/Japanese/Korean flavours. A personal creation!

### 2. **Breakfast**

Tasty breakfast options...

#### **Buttered Maple-Pear breakfast oatmeal with some seeds**  
  - Ingredients:  
    - steelcut oats
    - a few pears
    - unsalted butter
    - salt
    - maple syrup
    - cinammon/cardamom
    - assortment of nuts and seeds
  - Prep/Assembly Instructions:
    - The night before, soak 1 cup of steel-cut oats in a bowl of water; this cuts down on their cook time, similar to when making dried beans. The next morning, drain the oats then add them to a medium saucepan with four to five cups of fresh water and a pinch of kosher salt and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. 
    - Reduce heat to a bare simmer so you can only see a handful of bubbles gently burbling here and there. Cook the oatmeal, stirring occasionally, until it gets quite thick and it starts sticking to the bottom of the pot, about 20 to 30 minutes.
    - Chop up a pear or apple and add it to a small saucepan with a couple of tablespoons of water, butter, a teaspoon of pure maple syrup, and a sprinkling of warm spices (cinnamon, cardamom, and a grating of nutmeg). Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cook the fruit, covered, until it’s soft and sweet and the water has evaporated; this should only take a few minutes. 
    - Add cooked steel-cut oats and a splash of your favorite milk (I use homemade almond) and gently heat up the mixture until warmed through. Top with toasted walnuts, all the seeds (e.g., hemp, flax, chia), and more maple syrup if desired.
  - Notes: I used a modified version of the ["Oatmeal "](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/make-ahead-oatmeal).
