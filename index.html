  <h2>hello! im riki!</h2>

  <p>hello! this is a long-time coming but ive finally made a github pages.</p>
  <p>...and it may be a long-time yet before this is fully fleshed out. In the meantime, here's what you should know about me:</p>

  <p><strong>00.* Data analytics with a unique perspective in economics.</strong><br>
  I’ve spent 4-5 years as a research and data analyst in a variety of settings, which has allowed me to see the integration of data analytics in economics first-hand. *Why am I starting at 0? Because I'm zero-based indexing babyyyy.</p>

  <p><strong>01. I solve problems.</strong><br>
  I've developed ETL processes from scratch to streamline intake as a data engineer. I’m always looking for creative solutions to problems and more efficient ways to accomplish tasks.</p>

  <p><strong>02. I’m constantly learning new technologies.</strong><br>
  I have certifications in data engineering topics and MLOps. I'm frequently reading new research papers on AI and data science to learn cutting edge technologies and potential applicability to my work. Most recently, I experimented with Langchain to make an LLM web application to support foreign investors. Beyond data analytics, I'm also taking classes in judo and to become an amateur radio technician.</p>

  <p><strong>03. I’m detail-oriented, creative, and inspired.</strong><br>
  I want to use data to answer critical operational questions and offer actionable insights. I currently oversee a MLOps project to support agricultural training for farmers in the international development space.</p>

  <p><strong>04. I’m collaborative.</strong><br>
  At the end of the day, data analytics can't be done in a silo. I understand my own expertise and the expertise of my team; Working in cross-functional roles is my favourite strategy to collaborate on new analytics solutions. </p>
